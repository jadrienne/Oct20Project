                <h2>Janeah Adri√©nne</h2>
                <p>Founder</p>
            </header>

            <div class="article2">
            <p><span class="color">More about the Founder</span></p>
                    
            <p>Embarking on the journey of founding Bunnytears, my creative process evolved significantly
            over the years. Initially, in 2019, I found inspiration in the vast realms of the internet, 
            scrolling through Pinterest and admiring the works of fellow jewelry creators. However, as time
            passed, I recognized the need for authenticity in my designs. Relying solely on the creations of
            others began to feel like a limitation, stifling the genuine creative expression I longed for.</p>
                
            <p>A turning point came when I delved deeper into my own imaginative universe. I started to explore
            the intricate textures and colors of the beads I worked with, finding endless inspiration in their
            unique characteristics. The beads became my muse, sparking ideas that blended seamlessly with the themes
            I envisioned in my mind.

            Moreover, my creative horizons expanded to embrace the vast world of cinema and music. Each film became
            a canvas of emotions, each melody a symphony of inspiration. From the enchanting narratives of classic
            movies to the raw energy of punk rock anthems, I discovered a wellspring of creativity waiting to be
            tapped.</p>
                
            <p>This shift in perspective brought a newfound originality to my designs. Bunnytears ceased to be merely
            a jewelry brand; it became a canvas where my imagination ran wild, where the fusion of colors, shapes, and
            themes created pieces that told unique stories. By immersing myself in my own creative essence and drawing
            from the rich tapestry of life, I found the true essence of Bunnytears‚Äîa brand that echoes my authenticity,
            passion, and creativity.</p>

                <h3>Incorporating Stainless Steel Metals</h3>
                 <p>As the founder of Bunnytears, my journey began with a simple desire for quality and longevity in
                jewelry. In the early days, I used to buy pieces from small businesses, only to be disappointed as they
                easily rusted, losing their charm over time. This dissatisfaction fueled my determination to create something
                better. In 2019, when Bunnytears was born, I delved into extensive research and experimentation, particularly
                focusing on stainless steel materials.</p>
             </Aside>
        
             <p>Through meticulous trial and error, I discovered the durability and
                timeless appeal of stainless steel. Since then, I have embraced this metal in most of my creations, ensuring
                that every Bunnytears piece not only reflects creativity and style but also stands the test of time, promising
                enduring beauty to those who wear it.
