            <P>Bunnytears is a small handmade jewelry business. All jewelry are handmade by me,
                Janeah Adrienne. It first started as a jewelry DIY-making hobby in 2019. I soon fell 
                in love and became passionate about it; thus, the official Instagram shop was born.</P>
